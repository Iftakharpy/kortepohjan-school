# Introduction to the [technological documentation site](https://iftakharpy.github.io/kortepohjan-school/) for [Kortepohja Kindergarten School](https://peda.net/jyvaskyla/kortepohjanpaivakotikoulu)

This static site made with hugo and the relearn theme will be used to document some of the technologies available in Kortepohja's Kindergarten School. The goals are:

- The users will be able to learn about the technologies on their own when they need.
- They will be able to troubleshoot common problems easily on their own.
- If they need help with the specific technologies they can find contacts to the people who are already familiar with the technologies.
- Where to find each of the technologies at the school.
