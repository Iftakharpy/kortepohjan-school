## Reading materials

All [files related to Qu-16](https://www.allen-heath.com/hardware/qu/qu-16/resources/) can be found on **Alan&Heath**'s website. As a user we are only interested in the following documents:
1. [Getting started guide](/pdfs/mixers/qu/Qu-Mixer-Getting-Started-Guide-AP10025_2-V1.9-1.pdf)
2. [Reference guide](/pdfs/mixers/qu/Qu-Mixer-Reference-Guide-AP9372_10.pdf)

If you haven't already read the [Basics of Mixing](pdfs/mixers/basics_of_mixing.pdf) I highly recommend to do so now along with the above mentioned two documents. You can do the reading after watching the videos too.


## Video materials
- In my opinion, this is the `most important playlist` to watch for anyone who wants to learn Alan & Heath mixers. The instructor shows the students how to operate Qu-32 mixer. Duration is `1 hour 9 minutes`.
