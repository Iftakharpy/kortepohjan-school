In this chapter we will learn about the available audio mixers. At the school we have two audio mixers these are SQ-6 and Qu-16. Both are from Allen and Heath.

## Audio mixer introduction

The main use of a mixer is to combine and control multiple audio inputs/sources, and adjust the input stream to produce a cohesive and balanced audio output. When you have multiple audio sources and you need to put them in one output channel you need an audio mixer. Example of the usage of mixers are in live sound reinforcement, recording studios, broadcasting, podcasting, and public address systems. Some frequently asked questions and answers about audio mixers can be found on [Everything You Need To Know About Good Sound System](https://irukka.com/audio-mixers/understanding-audio-mixers-a-comprehensive-guide/).


## Recommended learning order

There are 3 sections in this chapter. You may have noticed that even though we do not have any Analog mixers at the school there is a section about that. Even though the devices are not exactly the same as the ones we have, it will help us to learn and use the audio mixers we have. In the end audio mixer's job is to mix audio. Recommended learning order for this section the same as the sections are ordered.
