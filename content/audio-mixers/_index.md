In this chapter we will learn about the available audio mixers. At the school we have two audio mixers these are SQ-6 and Qu-16. Both are from Allen and Heath.

## Audio mixer introduction

The main use of a mixer is to combine and control multiple audio inputs/sources, and adjust the input stream to produce a cohesive and balanced audio output. When you have multiple audio sources and you need to put them in one output channel you need an audio mixer. Example of the usage of mixers are in live sound reinforcement, recording studios, broadcasting, podcasting, and public address systems. Some frequently asked questions and answers about audio mixers can be found on [Everything You Need To Know About Good Sound System](https://irukka.com/audio-mixers/understanding-audio-mixers-a-comprehensive-guide/).
