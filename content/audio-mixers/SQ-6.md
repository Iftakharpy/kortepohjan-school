## Reading materials

All [files related to SQ-6](https://www.allen-heath.com/hardware/sq/sq-6/resources/) can be found on **Alan&Heath**'s website. As a user we are only interested in the following documents:
1. [SQ-6 Introduction](/pdfs/mixers/sq-6/SQ6_AP11349_Introduction_issue2.pdf)
2. [Reference guide](/pdfs/mixers/sq-6/SQ_ReferenceGuide_V1_5_0.pdf)

If you haven't already read the [Basics of Mixing](pdfs/mixers/basics_of_mixing.pdf) I highly recommend to do so now along with the above mentioned two documents. You can do the reading after watching the videos too.
